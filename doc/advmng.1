.SH DESCRIPTION 
The main purpose of this utility is to recompress MNG
files to get the smallest possible size.
.PP
Please note that this utility is not able to read
a generic file. It\(cqs garanted to be able to read only
the files generated by the AdvanceMAME emulator.
.PP
To compress the files this utility uses the following
strategies:
* Remove all ancillary chunks.
* Use the MNG Delta feature to compress video clips with
.PP
.RS 4
only small changes between frames.

.IP \(bu
Use the MNG Move feature to compress video clips with
a scrolling background (option \(hys).
.IP \(bu
Reduce the color depth to 8 bit (option \(hyr).
.IP \(bu
Use the 7zip Deflate implementation.

.SH OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \(hyl, \(hy\(hylist FILES...
List the content of the specified files.
.TP
.B \(hyz, \(hy\(hyrecompress FILES...
Recompress the specified files. If the \(hy1, \(hy2, \(hy3
options are specified, it\(cqs used the smallest file
choice from the previous compressed data and the
new compression. If the \(hy0 option is specified the
file is always rewritten without any compression.
.TP
.B \(hy0, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hystore
Disable the compression. The file is
only stored and not compressed. The file is always
rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hy1, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyfast
Set the compression level to \(a"fast\(a".
.TP
.B \(hy2, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hynormal
Set the compression level to \(a"normal\(a". This is the
default level of compression.
.TP
.B \(hy3, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyextra
Set the compression level to \(a"extra\(a".
.TP
.B \(hy4, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyinsane
Set the compression level to \(a"insane\(a". It\(cqs VERY
SLOW.
.TP
.B \(hys, \(hy\(hyscroll HxV
The \(a"\(hys HxV\(a" option specifies the size of the pattern
(H width x V height) used to check for a
scrolling background. The size is expressed in
pixels and it must be bigger or equal than the
scrolling speed of the background. For example
take the game 1942 that scrolls vertically by 1
pixel every frame. If you recorded with an interleave
factor of 2 the vertical scrolling speed is
1*2 = 2. In this case the minimun pattern is \(a"\(hys 0x2\(a".
Generally you can use \(a"\(hys 4x4\(a" and use bigger
values only for games scrolling faster. If the
game scrolls only horizontally or vertically you can
speed up a lot the compression with monodirectional
patterns like \(a"\(hys 8x0\(a" or \(a"\(hys 0x8\(a".
.TP
.B \(hyr, \(hy\(hyreduce
Force always the color reduction to 8 bit. The
compression will fail if exists a frame with more than
256 colors.
.TP
.B \(hye, \(hy\(hyexpand
Force always the color expansion to 24 bit.
.TP
.B \(hyc, \(hy\(hylc
Force the use of the MNG LC (Low Complexity)
specifications. It disables the delta compression.
The file is always rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hyC, \(hy\(hyvlc
Force the use of the MNG VLC (Very Low Complexity)
specifications. It disables the delta compression
and the precise timing. Warning! you may lose the
correct timing information because the VLC format
only supports integer frequency. The file is always
rewritten also if it\(cqs bigger.
.TP
.B \(hyf, \(hy\(hyforce
Force the use of the new file also if it\(cqs bigger.
